### Computational analysis Project

*Dante Aviñó, Miguel Borge, Pol Segura*

------

The main objective of the project is to **annotate the genes** included in the contig and to **functionally characterize** the predicted proteins.

Download assigned contig from a nematode species.

Annotate the genes included in the contig and to functionally characterize the predicted proteins.

- **ab-initio tools** to obtain a first prediction (select closest species in model)
- **blast search** to identify the putative proteins (more sensitive if protein level instead of nucleotides)
- **homology-based tools** with the annotations of  a closely related species (web-server/local)

Discuss the performance of the different methods. Can you guess to which species does
your contig correspond?
