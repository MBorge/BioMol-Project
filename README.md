# BioMol-Project
The main objective of the project is to annotate the genes included in the contig and to functionally characterize the predicted proteins.

Download assigned contig from a nematode species.
- ab-initio tools to obtain a first prediction (select closest species in model)
- blast search to identify the putative proteins (more sensitive if protein level instead of nucleotides)
- homology-based tools with the annotations of  a closely related species (web-server/local)

Annotate the genes included in the contig and to functionally characterize the predicted proteins.

Discuss the performance of the different methods. Can you guess to which species does
your contig correspond?
